### These are some Projects i've worked.

For the last 5 years I have been technically representing a predictive maintenance technology developed in Europe with the support of a European team. The technology works by collecting electrical signals to predict failures of motors, transformers, solar panels and wind turbines. The system generates a large amount of data, which allows us to work on creating other solutions and generating new insights for customer maintenance teams. I am responsible for the project, from the production of equipment abroad to data analysis and practical application to anticipate problems in the field. I'm currently testing Machine Learning models to extract more insights with feedback from maintenance teams.
I also took courses, freelanced and participated in several bootcamps where I had the opportunity to work with other tools, such as:

### 1) Cloud:
> #Project 1: AWS (10 services), building a 100% cloud streaming system based on CDN (content delivery network);  
> #Project 2: AWS+GCP (05 services) Migration of on-premises data to Cloud. On-premises architecture: VM+MySQL. Cloud Architecture: AWS S3 + Google GCR, GKE, Cloud SQL + Terraform.

### 2) Python projects:
> #Project 1: Automation of tasks, extraction of data exported from SQL (.csv), generation and sending of dashboards and reports by email;
> #Project 2: Webscraping to obtain updated quotes for financial purposes (signaling the moment of acquisition or sale of commodities);
> #Project 3: Analysis of purchase history and customer behavior data to identify and create a customer profile model.
